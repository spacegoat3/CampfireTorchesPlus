<p>This very simple mod adds a new feature that lets you make torches using Campfires. But, hence the 
name, it also has some extra features.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How The Mod Works</h2>
<p>- To make a torch, you just need to right-click a Campfire with a Stick. <em>(The cost amount can be 
changed through the config.)</em></p>
<p>- Depending on the campfire type, the torch type also changes. If you use a Normal Campfire you 
will get a Normal Torch. If you use a Soul Campfire you will get a Soul Torch.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- If a campfire is unlit, you won't be able to make torches.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- When you make a torch using a campfire, a custom sound effect will play. And if you make a torch using a Soul Campfire, Soul Sand Block's sound effect will play alongside that custom sound effect. <em>(You can disable these sound effects through the config.)</em></p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<p><strong>Will you port this mod to Forge?</strong></p>
<p>I am a new, inexperienced developer and in my opinion, Fabric is much easier to code than Forge. Therefore a Forge Port is not planned for 
now but maybe in the future. (If you want to port this mod to Forge, you can, I would be glad.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Can I use this mod in Project X?</strong></p>
<p>This project is licensed under MIT License, a free and open-source license, which means you can use this project in nearly every way you want. 
But please remember to credit me if your project is public.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Will you port this mod to below 1.17?</strong></p>
<p>Even though the programming language between 1.17 and 1.16 is not so different, I am still an inexperienced developer and I don't have much 
time in my personal life. So, I am sorry but the answer is no.</p>
